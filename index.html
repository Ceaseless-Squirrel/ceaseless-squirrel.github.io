<hr>
<p>Your neighborhood is glittering with festive Christmas lights, and you decide tonight is the night to string up your own. Your spouse is gone away for work for the next few days, and it’s a peaceful night in your neighborhood.</p>

<p>You get out the various strings of lights, and set up your ladder. After a couple hours and a hot chocolate break, you have several strings of lights up.  Before you finish for the night, you decide to set up the inflatable Santa and reindeer that your spouse insists must be on the roof each year.</p>

<p>You haul up Rudolph and Santa, and set them up, then Dasher and Dancer. You bring up a few more sets of lights for Santa’s sleigh, and momentarily place them around Dasher’s neck until you need them. Unfortunately, the lights were too heavy for inflated animal, and it begins sliding directly towards the ladder!</p>

<a href="/3.html">You watch the reindeer slide away and hope nothing bad happens.</a>
